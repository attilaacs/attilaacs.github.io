Behind every piece of art, music or performance is a chain of beautifully engineered piece of technology. Its job is to get out of the way and let creativity take centre stage. In this design I wanted to emphasize the science & technology that goes into the making of a piece of gear.

The console featured in the design is the Custom Series 75 Powered by Neve (visit Studio 6 at 301 Sydney to see one in person!), a product that I have been personally involved with. During its pre-production, I created 3D models of a range of console sizes to be used for the website and the online configurator. The 32 channel model forms the basis for this design and helped me to create this set of accurate views from different perspectives.
